### Development Tips:

- **Migration Files**: Create migration files in Laravel for each table following the suggested sequence. Ensure each migration correctly sets up the necessary foreign keys.
- **Eloquent Models**: Define Eloquent models for each table and set up the relationships (e.g., `hasMany`, `belongsTo`) as you go.
- **Seeder Files**: Optionally, create seeder files to populate tables with initial data for testing.
- **Routes and Controllers**: Implement routes and controllers in parallel with table creation to handle CRUD operations.

By following this prioritized order, you'll establish a solid foundation for your WatchHub project, ensuring that each table's dependencies are met before you proceed to the next. This approach helps to streamline the development process and avoid issues with missing references or dependencies.
